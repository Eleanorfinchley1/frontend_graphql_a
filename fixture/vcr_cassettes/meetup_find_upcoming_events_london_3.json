Come and make the most of your weekend with lots of great guys and girls. And you can practise your languages whilst speaking with native speakers.</p> <p>See venue details above. It's free entry, just show the door staff your government photo ID and ask them for a wristband for the Mammoth Language Exchange event, then join us in our private area.</p> <p>We give everyone name &amp; language badges to make it easy to meet people who speak the language that you want to practise, and there are games on tables as ice breakers. And with the wristband we get discounts on drinks.</p> <p>It's best if you arrive early but you're welcome to come a little later, and it's fine for you to come on your own. Everyone is welcoming and happy to chat. Most of the guys and girls come every Sunday and make some good friends here.</p> <p>See you there this Sunday! :)</p> \",\"visibility\":\"public\",\"member_pay_fee\":false,\"description_images\":[],\"featured_photo\":{\"id\":467299890,\"highres_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/b/2/highres_467299890.jpeg\",\"photo_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/b/2/600_467299890.jpeg\",\"thumb_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/d/b/2/thumb_467299890.jpeg\",\"type\":\"event\",\"base_url\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com\"},\"event_hosts\":[{\"id\":5210460,\"name\":\"Chandresh\",\"intro\":\"Hi everyone!\",\"photo\":{\"id\":138410482,\"highres_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/5/3/2/highres_138410482.jpeg\",\"photo_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/5/3/2/member_138410482.jpeg\",\"thumb_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/5/3/2/thumb_138410482.jpeg\",\"type\":\"member\",\"base_url\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com\"},\"role\":\"coorganizer\",\"host_count\":1489,\"join_date\":1346016242000},{\"id\":53777112,\"name\":\"Chandresh\",\"intro\":\"Hi, I'm Chandresh, I like to learn languages and meet new people.\",\"photo\":{\"id\":62339522,\"highres_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/8/8/2/highres_62339522.jpeg\",\"photo_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/8/8/2/member_62339522.jpeg\",\"thumb_link\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/8/8/2/thumb_62339522.jpeg\",\"type\":\"member\",\"base_url\":\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com\"},\"role\":\"organizer\",\"host_count\":1466,\"join_date\":1342057608000},{\"id\":94214392,\"name\":\"Lucie Masopustová\",\"intro\":\"Hey!

Fast. This workshop will explain why and when you might want to use TypeScript, and get you up and running with all the essentials. In this workshop we will cover practically the full language. And we will go deep. That is: do the cool and weird meta programming stuff. Learn all the tricks you won't find in the handbook.</p> <p>This workshop is also suitable for those that have basic experience with TypeScript. Since the basics only take ~2 hours to cover, most of the day is still super valuable to enhance your TypeScript skills, even if you already have real project experience with TypeScript! Did you ever encounter super confusing types in some of the libraries you use? Did you get some super vague compiler errors?
